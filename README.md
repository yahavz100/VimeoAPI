# VimeoAPI

I was asked to create a script that connects to Vimeo through Vimeo API that performs the following tasks:
1. Write a comment to the video
2. Print the number of likes the video has
3. Print the number of views the video has

The initial step was to read about API interfacing using: <BR/> 
https://developer.vimeo.com/api/guides/start <BR/>
https://github.com/vimeo/vimeo.py

After that, I was required to make some preliminary preparations so that I could test the script, therefore I set up a user and uploaded videos.

## Working flow:
1. Log in successfully to Vimeo API
2. Get familiarized with the received JSON file and relevant POST and GET commands
3. Perform task number 2
4. Perform task number 3
5. Perform task number 1
6. Final closures and fine-tuning(documentation/code)
